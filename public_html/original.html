    Army Men: The tabletop combat game
    </h2>
    <p>
    <h3>
    Motivations:
    </h3>
    <p>
    After having observed many figure based combat simulation games, I 
    became convinced that the games were mostly designed to sell figures.  
    Being way to cheap too buy into that sort of game, I long wanted to 
    make one based on cheap readily available army men.  
    Something like
    <a href="http://www.brikwars.com/rules/2000/contents.htm">brikwars</a>
    but not so complicated.
    With the large 
    number of army men given as gifts this x-mas, I finally was inspired 
    to really do it.
    
    <p>
    <h3>
    Rules:
    </h3>
    <p>
    
    The basic needs of the game are a place to play, a sack of army men, 
    a tape measure or yardstick, and a six-sided die.  The rules should 
    all fit on a single sheet of paper with a reasonable font size.  
    Realism is not a goal.  The idea is for the snacks and drinks to 
    cost more than the game pieces, and for you to be able to buy both at the 
    same store.
    
    <p>
    
    Setup consists of clearing the table, and setting up any desired 
    obsticles with books, cans, legos, whatever is handy.  Both 
    players should agree on obstacle placement.  Players should also 
    agree on the goal/setting of the engagement, number of men per 
    side, and terms of victory.  
    
    <p>
    
    Play is handled in turns, in each turn, a player may have each 
    of his men take one action step.  An action step consists of 
    two parts: Shooting and action.  If the man is to shoot, he 
    must shoot before moving, this is to give the advantage to a 
    fixed position/ambush setup.
    
    <p>
    Shooting proceeds as follows:  Select a enemy man as the 
    target, then use the tape measure to determine if he is in 
    range, and if there is a line of sight between the two men.
    If these conditions are met, the shooter rolls one dice 
    per rate of fire, and kills the enemy man on a roll of 6 if 
    the enemy is in range, and 5 or 6 if the enemy is within 1/2 
    of the maximum range.
    <p>
    For movement, the man can move any distance up to the rated 
    movement number of inches, and movement does not need to be 
    in a straight line.  Men can climb obstacles as long as they 
    are not taller than the man.  No penalty is applied for 
    climbing.  Prone men can climb the height of a standard man.  
    Men moving beyond the edge of the table cannot be returned to 
    play.  
    <p>
    If two opposing men come into contact, they will fight 
    hand-to-hand, both players will roll 1D6.  The attacking player
    can add 1 to his score.  The lowest scoring man will die.
    In the event of a tie, the 
    fight will continue into the next turn.  In the next turn, 
    niether man can attack, and the attacked man can choose to 
    run away, or continue the fight, taking the attack +1 advantage.
    <p>
    Each type of army man is assigned three attributes:
      Movement and Range in inches, rate of fire in number of rolls.

    prone men have half the movement, but double the range of a standing 
    army man.  Regular men cannot be switched back and forth with prone 
    men.  For simplicity, kneeling men are considered to be standing.

    <p>
    
      Area effect weapons (except grenades) are heavy and 
    hard to move, so the man cannot fire and move in the 
    same turn.  When shooting an area effect weapon, the 
    shooting player selects a target man (must have line 
    of sight to aim), all men (on any side) within 6 
    inches of the target man must roll 1d6 and if a 6 is 
    rolled, that man will die.
    <p>
    
      When a man dies, he is knocked over (or placed upsidedown 
    for prone men) and left on the table.  Dead men cannot be 
    returned to play.

      Doing a search, I found other games with plastic army men
    but most were too complex:

    This one was simple enough, but don't like actually throwing stuff around.

    Also found this older game by none other than H.G.Wells.  
    It seems to require having guns that really shoot tho.
    I did like the idea of there being a time limit to each turn to put pressure on the players:

    "That seemed fair; but so desperate is the courage and devotion of lead
    soldiers, that it came to this, that any small force that got or seemed
    likely to get isolated and caught by a superior force instead of waiting
    to be taken prisoners, dashed at its possible captors and slew them
    man for man."
