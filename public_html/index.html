                    The basic needs of the game are a place to play, a sack of army men, a tape measure or yardstick,
                    and a six-sided dice (D6). Realism is not a goal, only fun.
                </p>

                <h2 id="tutorial-rules-army-creation">The Squad</h2>
                <p>
                    To start, pick 5 regular troopers that look cool. These guys are going to teach you how to play the
                    game.
                </p>

                <h3>Movement and Equipment</h3>
                <p>
                    Each army trooper is assigned three attributes: Movement and Range in inches, rate of fire
                    in number of rolls.
                </p>

                <table class="table table-dark">

                <p>
                    The players need a table or some clear space on the floor.
                </p>
                <h3>Deployment</h3>
                <p>
                    Setup your squad 24" away from your opponents squad, with all members no more than 4" apart.
                </p>

                <h2 id="tutorial-rules-turn-description">Turn Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Play is handled in turns, in each turn, a player may have each of his troopers take one action step
                    (they may also choose to do nothing). An action step consists of two parts: Shooting and action. If
                    the trooper is to shoot, they must shoot before moving, this is to give the advantage to a fixed
                    position/ambush setup.
                </p>

                <h3>Phase 1: Shooting</h3>
                <p>
                    Shooting proceeds as follows: Select an enemy trooper as the target, then use the tape measure to
                    determine if they are in range, and if there is a line of sight between the two troopers. If these
                    conditions are met, the shooter rolls one dice per rate of fire, and kills the enemy trooper on a
                    roll of 5+ if the enemy is in range, and 4+ if the enemy is within 1/2 of the maximum range. If the
                    target moved in the previous turn, they are harder to hit and recieve a <b>-1 modifier</b> (e.g. a roll of 5
                    at a distance greater than half the shooters range would miss).
                </p>
                <h4>Friendly Fire</h4>
                <p>
                    Either player may choose to target troopers in combat, but after rolling to hit in the usual way, 
                    1D2 is rolled to determine which combatant is hit (1 is your trooper, 2 is theirs).
                </p>

                <h3>Phase 2: Movement</h3>
                <p>
                    For movement, the trooper can move any distance up to the rated movement number of inches, and
                    movement does not need to be in a straight line. They must stay within 4" of another squad member.
                    Troopers moving beyond the edge of the table cannot be returned to play.
                </p>

                <h3>Phase 3: Combat</h3>
                <p>
                    If two opposing troopers come into contact, they will fight hand-to-hand, both players will roll
                    1D6. The attacking player adds a <b>+1 modifier</b> to his score to account for inititiative. The lowest scoring 
                    trooper will die. In the event of a tie, the fight will continue into the next turn. In the next
                    turn, the attacked trooper can choose to run away, or continue the fight, but may not shoot. If the combat
                    continues the scoring has no modifier.
                </p>
                <h4>Ganging Up</h4>
                <p> 
                    If the number of combatants on either side is not equal, apply a <b>+1 modifier</b> for each additional
                    trooper (e.g. if one trooper is fighting three, the single trooper rolls regularly, but the three
                    troopers all get a +2 modifier for their hits). The results of each pair is determined seperately.
                </p>

                <h3>The Inevitable End</h3>
                <p>
                    When a trooper dies, they are removed from the table. Dead troopers cannot be returned to play.
                </p>

                    The basic needs of the game are a place to play, a sack of army men, a tape measure or yardstick, and a
                    six-sided die. Realism is not a goal, only fun. Also, this is intended to be a framework and we
                    can update it as necessary to address balance issues, and add new features.

                <p>
                    The players need to set up the board and create armies before the game can start.
                </p>

                <h3>Terrain</h3>
                <p>
                    Setup consists of clearing the table, and setting up any desired obstacles with books, cans,
                    legos,
                    whatever is handy. Both players should agree on obstacle placement. Players should also agree on
                    the
                    goal/setting of the engagement, points value of their respective armies, and terms of victory
                    (annihilation, capture the flag, etc.).
                </p>

                <h4>Cover</h4>
                <p>
                    If any trooper is more than half concealed by terrain they are considered in cover, and is has a
                    +1
                    modifier to hit (e.g. if a trooper is within half range the shooter would need to roll a 6
                    instead of a
                    5+). If a target trooper is at more than half range (and in cover), they are considered safe
                    from fire.
                    Vehicles do not benefit from cover due to their size.
                </p>

                <h3>Possible Scenario: Capture the Flag</h4>
                <p>
                    Agree on a location and place a marker on the board to designate a strategic objective. Roll
                    2D6 to
                    determine the number of troopers (sargents, regular guys, etc.) you need to have within 1D6
                    inches
                    at the beginning of 1D3 turns for that player (e.g. 7 troopers within 4" of the marker for
                    the start
                    of 2 turns to win the game).
                </p>


                <h2 id="standard-rules-army-creation">Army Creation</h2>
                <p>
                    To keep things as even as possible use the following point system. Decide on a total number
                    of
                    points for the competing armies before you start. They don't need to be the same if for
                    example one
                    army is defending a base and has cover.
                </p>


                <h3>Troops</h3>
                <p>
                    Squads are 5-10 troopers. Each squad can include a sargent. A normal squad may have up to
                    two
                    special weapons in it (2 submachine guns, 2 heavy weapons, or a combination).

                    Troopers must stay within 4" of another squad member. If they are not for some reason then
                    all dice
                    rolls for this individual have a +1 modifier (e.g. 5's rolled for them will count as 6's to

                    Prone men have half the movement, but double the range of a standing army trooper. Regular
                    men
                    cannot be switched back and forth with prone men. For simplicity, kneeling men are
                    considered to be

                <p>
                    Area effect weapons (except grenades) are heavy and hard to move, so the trooper cannot fire
                    and
                    move in the same turn. When shooting an area effect weapon, the shooting player selects a
                    target
                    trooper (must have line of sight to aim), all troopers (on any side) within 6" of the target
                    trooper
                    must roll 1D6 and if a 6 is rolled, that trooper is toast.

                <h3>Vehicles</h3>
                <p>There are some vehicles that your army can be outfitted with like boats and tanks. They are
                    useful
                    for different scenarios.</p>
                <h4>Tanks</h4>

                <h2 id="standard-rules-turn-description">Turn Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Play is handled in turns, in each turn, a player may have each of his troopers take one
                    action step
                    (they may also choose to do nothing). An action step consists of two parts: Shooting and
                    action. If
                    the trooper is to shoot, they must shoot before moving, this is to give the advantage to a
                    fixed
                    position/ambush setup.
                </p>

                <h3>Phase 1: Shooting</h3>
                <p>
                    Shooting proceeds as follows: Select an enemy trooper as the target, then use the tape
                    measure to
                    determine if they are in range, and if there is a line of sight between the two troopers. If
                    these
                    conditions are met, the shooter rolls one dice per rate of fire, and kills the enemy trooper
                    on a
                    roll of 6 if the enemy is in range, and 5 or 6 if the enemy is within 1/2 of the maximum
                    range.
                </p>

                <h3>Phase 2: Movement</h3>
                <p>
                    For movement, the trooper can move any distance up to the rated movement number of inches,
                    and
                    movement does not need to be in a straight line. troopers can climb obstacles as long as
                    they are
                    not taller than the trooper. No penalty is applied for climbing. Prone troopers can climb
                    the height
                    of a standard trooper. troopers moving beyond the edge of the table cannot be returned to
                    play.
                </p>

                <h3>Phase 3: Combat</h3>
                <p>
                    If two opposing troopers come into contact, they will fight hand-to-hand, both players will
                    roll
                    1D6. The attacking player can add 1 to his score. The lowest scoring trooper will die. In
                    the event
                    of a tie, the fight will continue into the next turn. In the next turn, niether trooper can
                    attack,
                    and the attacked trooper can choose to run away, or continue the fight, taking the attack +1
                    advantage.
                </p>
                <h3>The Inevitable End</h3>
                <p>
                    When a trooper dies, they are removed from the table. Dead troopers cannot be returned to
                    play.
