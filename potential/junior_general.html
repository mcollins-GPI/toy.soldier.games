    <B><FONT FACE="Arial">Equipment Needed:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> One 
    48-card deck per player (Kings removed) or a 12-sided die, a yardstick, plastic 
    army men and models, junk (rocks, buildings, trees, etc...). Players must and 
    may only shuffle at the end of every turn or if deck runs out. Players who wish 
    may use a 12-sided die instead of cards, with &quot;1&quot; counting as an ace. The game 
    also works at 15mm, 20mm, 25mm scale. To be honest, these scales look better. 
    Here are some
    <a href="http://www.juniorgeneral.org/index.php/figure/figureList/ww2">paper 
    soldiers</a> you can print and use.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
    <B>Sequence of Play</B>: (players alternate, both players taking
    a turn counts as one game turn)<BR>
    1. Moving side moves any/all guys and models (movement over 2in
    may trigger opfire) <BR>
    2. Defending side fires any/all guys and models not touching enemy,
    (unless already opfired). 3. Moving side's units touching enemy
    fire*.<BR>
    4. Defending side's units touching enemy fire, even if they already
    fired this turn*.<BR>
    * MGguys, Bazookaguys and Mortarguys fighting guys in phases 3&amp;4
    attack as Rguys.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Movement:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
    Guys (only) can move thru woods. Guys move over or through anything
    reasonable (i.e. not high walls w/o windows). Touching units are
    called &quot;groups&quot; and may move simultaneously. After moving
    2&quot;, figures or models may be fired upon by the enemy (op-fire).
    No unit may fire more than once (total) during phases 1 &amp;
    2, except for &quot;(repeat)&quot; fire.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Firing:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
    Fire only at targets in range and in sight (use your eyes or periscope
    or a laser, you can't see thru wooded areas or buildings, but
    you can see figures at the edges (base partly in and partly out).
    Pull a card or roll a die, if it is within the specified numbers,
    then the target dies (Aces are low, which is good). If the firing
    number says &quot;touch&quot; you can only fire at that type of
    target in phase 3 &amp; 4. Units touching enemy may not fire in
    phases 1 or 2.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Repeat Firing:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
    When a firing unit with &quot;repeat&quot; hits, it can fire again
    but only if it can see a new guy to shoot at within 6&quot; of
    the original (any but MG firing) or last (MG firing) guy fired
    at. Targets must be in sight and in range. Units using opfire
    may repeat fire on any valid target, not just targets which have
    moved &gt;2&quot;.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Removing Dead Guys:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
    Each time a guy is fired at, the attacker must say who he is firing
    at. If the attacker is firing on a figure who is not in a group,
    or the range is 3&quot; or less, or if he hits with an ace (die
    roll of &quot;1&quot;), that exact guy dies. Otherwise, the defending
    player has the option to remove either the guy fired at or any
    other guy (that the shooter can see and is in range of) in the
    same group as the target.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Cover:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
    Guys or Cannon who are shot at with bullets (MG or Rifle Guy firing)
    are in cover if they are even partly in woods, in a building or
    behind a wall or corner or sandbags, etc&#133;. If in cover you
    are not hit on black cards (or on even # if using dice).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Breakdowns:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
    Firer pulling Q of Spades (or rolling &quot;12&quot;) draws (rolls)
    again. 2nd Spade (or 2nd roll of &quot;12&quot;) kills model or
    replaces guy with a Rifle Guy. Rifle Guys may ignore this rule.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Loading or Unloading:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> Loading models don't move, loadees must start turn
    within 3in. Unloading costs half movement of vehicle (may move
    before or after unloading). Unloading guys/cannon are placed within
    3&quot; and not touching enemy and move no further. Killing vehicles
    kills what's inside. Loaded guys/cannon can't shoot or be shot
    at, except up to 2 Grenade Guys, Rifle Guys or MG Guys may fire
    from a halftrack.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">The Basic Game (200pts):</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial"> Each side places 0 to 3 pieces of terrain (6in
    to 2ft on a side, no player may place a terrain feature within
    2ft of a feature he previously placed) on a 5ft x 8ft table. Each
    player draws a card. Alternate placement, with high draw placing
    first. After terrain is placed, draw again. Side drawing high
    chooses one side to be his and places his units first w/n 3in
    of that edge. Pillbox models may be placed further in, up to a
    foot. Then the other side places his units w/in 12in of opposite
    edge. Side which placed units first moves first. When 1/2 your
    guys die (Models count as 5 &quot;guys&quot; for this calculation)
    you lose.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Example:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
    I have 4 tanks, 2 jeeps, and 60 guys and a truck and a cannon.
    This gives me 8 models and 40 guys. This means I have 5x8(models)
    + 40(actual guys) = 40+40 = 80 &quot;potential dead guys&quot;
    (PDG's) for purposes of calculating losses. This means I lose
    the game if I lose 40 &quot;guys&quot; worth of stuff. So If I
    lose 10 models, or 8 models and 10 guys, or whatever, I lose.
    Enemy units exited off of the center 4&quot; of your side of the
    table leave the game permanently but count as guys lost by YOUR
    side. Example: A Russian pins down the German force listed above
    and kills 10 guys. He then exits 6 T34 tanks off the German's
    rear edge. This counts as 10+30=40 points inflicted on the Germans.
    They lose. If nobody has won by turn 30, the game is a draw and
    you need to ask yourself why you bothered playing in the first
    place.<BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Purchasing Limits For the Basic Game:</B> No more than 1/6
    of points can go to any one type of guy except for Rifle Guys.
    No more than 50% of points may be used on Tanks, AA Tanks, and
    Armored Cars combined. No more than 4 jeeps, 3 cannons, 1 large
    pillbox or 2 small pillboxes may be bought per 100 points. At
    least 1/3 of points must be spent on Guys. No rafts or landing
    craft or amphibs. You may buy up to two 4&quot; diameter sandbagged
    or similar features (counts as cover) at a cost of 5 each.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Designer's Notes:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
    This game is not so silly as it looks and sound tactics are rewarded.
    It lends itself surprisingly well to re-creations of small scale
    (or reduced scale) historical battles. Players are encouraged
    to make whatever changes are necessary to model historical situations
    on a case-by-case basis. For example, British tanks in North Africa
    prior to Alamein should not be able to fire their cannons except
    at armored targets (cost=17), KV tanks in 1941 should probably
    count as &quot;Tigers&quot;. British Bren gun carriers should
    be as halftracks and allowed to carry only 4 guys and should cost
    about 9, etc&#133;<BR>

    presence.<BR>
    <B>German:</B> 3 &quot;Tiger Tanks&quot;, 9 Tanks, 4 Halftracks,
    28 Rguys, 4 MGguys 2 Flamethrowers, 2 Mortarguys, 4 Grenadeguys.
    Enter South edge turn 1.<BR>
    <B>Soviets:</B> 14 Tanks, 50Rguys, 4MGguys, 4 Mortarguys, 4 Grenadeguys
    1 truck, 1 cannon. Set up within 2ft of North edge. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Victory:</B> Germans move first. Side with most tanks (including
    Tigers) after Russian T 12 wins. <BR>
    Special Rules: Tiger tanks have a range of 4 feet (cost=40). Every
    time a J of Spades is drawn (must use cards for this scenario),
    dust clouds cover the map.(or, if present, stop). In dust clouds,
    nobody can see more than 1 foot.</FONT></P>
    
    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Historical Outcome:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
    Several hundred tanks make a lot of dust. The reduced visibility
    allowed for close-range combat, nullifying the superior weaponry
    and armor of the German heavies. The largest tank battle of the
    war ended with both sides severely mauled and the only German
    breakthrough of &quot;Citadel&quot; blocked. Who won? The Russians
    could easily replace their losses, but the Germans couldn't. Add
    that to the fact that the German mission (to breakthrough and
    exploit that breakthrough in the Russian rear) failed, and the
    Russians probably &quot;won&quot; in the grand scheme of things.</FONT></P>

    British glider troops attempt to seize a critical Orne Canal Bridge
    and keep it until help arrives.<BR>
    <B>British Glider Troops:</B> 30 Rguys, 4 MGguys 8 Grenadeguys,
    3 Mortarguys, 3 Bazookaguys. Start in area marked &quot;G&quot;

    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Historical Outcome:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
    The elite British glider troops took the bridge with only two
    casualties. The Germans heard the landing but assumed it was the
    wreckage of a shot-down bomber, and were not ready (our scenario
    shows them as a tad more alert to give them a fighting chance).
    You may recognize the title quote from the voice-over in the classic
    film &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, which features this action.</FONT></P>

    <B><U>Scenario 10 - Dog Beach (6/6/44):</U></B> The 116th Regt
    (29th Inf Division) has been pinned down on Omaha Beach. Reinforcements
    arrive in the form of C. Company, Provisional Ranger Group (5th
    Ranger Bttn). The DD Tanks which were supposed to have supported
    the landing have sunk, the preparatory gunfire was ineffective,
    and the old men and rejects supposed to be opposing the landing
    turn out instead to be a veteran German infantry division (the
    352nd). This scenario portrays the most difficult landing sector
    on the most heavily opposed beach (Omaha) on D Day. This action
    was featured in &quot;The Longest Day&quot; and also in the first
    few minutes of the film &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, although
    in reality, the Captain in charge of the ranger unit was named
    Goranson, not Miller. The map is fairly accurate, but exact German
    equipment and forces are on a best-guess basis. The hills are
    steep but scalable, with the famously difficult cliffs scaled
    by 2nd Ranger Bttn off-map to the West.<BR>
    <B>German:</B> 35xRguys, 2xGrenadeguys, 20xEntrenchments. Place
    these anywhere on or South of top of hill line. In addition, see
    map for placement of following: 1x Large Pillbox &quot;[P]&quot;,
    1x Small Pillbox &quot;[p]&quot;, and 6xMGguys &quot;M&quot;.
    MG's are emplaced and may not move, although they may be abandoned
    (replace MGguy with Rguy). Large Pillbox has only antipersonell
    shells and cannot fire on landing craft.<BR>
    116th Rgt (-): 24Rguys set up behind seawall (counts as cover),
    10 more Rguys set up 14&quot; from base of hill slope W of Veirville
    Draw (the big canyon with the road thru it). No more than 4 guys
    may be in any group (touching). No groups or individual guys may
    be within 8&quot; of any other groups or individual guys.<BR>
    <B>C. Co:</B> 2xLanding Craft, 19xRguys, 2xMGguys, 4xEngineerguys,
    8xGrenadeguys. Start within 6&quot; of N edge (South is &quot;up&quot;
    on the map).<BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Map: </B>Ocean not to exceed 1ft, distance from seawall to
    top of hill line should be 14&quot;, hill slope should be 4&quot;
    broad. Seawall must be 13&quot; from top of hill line (MG's on
    hill are out of Rguy range).</FONT></P>
    
    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Special Rules:</FONT></B><FONT FACE="Arial">
    Hills represent the raised ground off the beach and really should
    have no reverse (south) side (more like a mesa or shelf, with
    the S part of the map raised). Units moving on, onto or off the
    hils move only 3&quot; due to the steepness of the hills. Americans
    move first, win if there are more Americans than Germans in buildings
    at end of US turn 16.</FONT></P>
