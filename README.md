## Revision Thoughts
 - what if both players shoot then don't move? they would only progress until someone hits a 6
  - the area of the game might hit a snag because the player doesn't have incentive to move away from their flag
 - doing something for setting up troopers that aren't seen would be cool too, like maybe a way for them to hide to get a bonus to hit
 - you could also change it so that you can move before shooting but have to roll higher to hit. I just see a scenario where nobody wants to move
