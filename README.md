## Revision Thoughts
 - what if both players shoot then don't move? they would only progress until someone hits a 6
 - the area of the game might hit a snag because the player doesn't have incentive to move away from their flag
 - doing something for setting up troopers that aren't seen would be cool too, like maybe a way for them to hide to get a bonus to hit
 - you could also change it so that you can move before shooting but have to roll higher to hit. I just see a scenario where nobody wants to move 
 - move then shoot +1 modifier
 - I have a idea. What if the raft is two hits and when that is destroyed the people on the raft go in the water you only need to roll a three if they did not move
 - vehicles have 10 hits can move 10 inches
 - I also think we could put a guy that fits and let him drive the tank but when the guy is out you can't destroy the tank also when the guy is in youmhave to roll
 - guys ride on tank
 - tank can move 8 or 10 inches
 - simple terrain
 - height advantage
 - printable maps
 - if we add mountins and hills the guys on the hill or mountins even if they are with in 10'' you still have to roll a 6 and the guys on the ground even if they moved and there with in 10'' you have to roll a six.
